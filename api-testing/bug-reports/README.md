# 🐞 Bug Reports – API Testing Portfolio

This folder contains documented bug reports identified during **manual and API testing** activities as part of my QA training and practice projects.

The goal of these reports is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Analyze API behavior against requirements
- Detect functional inconsistencies early
- Clearly document bugs following industry best practices
- Provide solid evidence to support reproducibility and validation

---

## 📌 Scope

The bug reports focus mainly on **REST API testing**, including:

- Positive and negative test scenarios
- Validation of HTTP status codes
- Request/response body validation
- Boundary and equivalence class testing
- Backend logic verification

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Postman** – API request execution and validation  
- **Jira** – Bug tracking and issue documentation  
- **JSON** – Response structure analysis  
- **REST APIs** – Backend behavior testing
